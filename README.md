# Controlling-Machines-with-Human-Brain
In BCI research, our aim is clear: enhance algorithmic consistency across subjects by addressing the variance in brain signals. Our solution, "Whitening Transform" or BCICW, precedes Eigen Face Analysis (EFA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) using EEG data from channels C3, Cz, C5, and trials from nine subjects, helps uniform classification
